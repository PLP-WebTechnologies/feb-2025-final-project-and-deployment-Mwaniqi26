Project Documentation: Multipage Website
Project Overview
This project is a multipage website designed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It includes three pages:

Home Page

About Page

Contact Page

The website is responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices. It also includes basic form validation using JavaScript on the contact page.

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages, making it accessible from anywhere with a live URL.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the semantic structure of the website.

CSS3: Used for styling the layout and making the site responsive.

JavaScript: Used for interactivity, including form validation on the contact page.

GitHub Pages: Used for deploying the website.

Features
Responsive Design:

The website is fully responsive using CSS media queries.

The navigation menu and layout adjust to fit smaller screens, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile devices.

Form Validation (on the Contact Page):

JavaScript is used to validate the form inputs.

If any field is left empty, the user is alerted to fill in all required fields before submitting the form.

Navigation:

Easy-to-use navigation menu with links to the home, about, and contact pages.

Navigation is fixed at the top of the page for easy access.

Semantic HTML:

The HTML structure uses semantic tags (such as <header>, <footer>, <main>, and <section>) to ensure accessibility and search engine optimization.

Pages
Home Page (index.html):

Introduction to the website.

Simple welcome message and an overview of what the website offers.

About Page (about.html):

Provides information about the website or company.

Includes a brief description and any relevant information about the team or project.

Contact Page (contact.html):

A contact form where users can submit their name, email, and a message.

JavaScript form validation ensures all fields are filled in before submission.

How to Deploy
Using GitHub Pages:
Create a new repository on GitHub.

Push all the files of the project (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the repository.

Go to the repository settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and set the source to the main branch (usually main or master).

Your website will be live at https://github.com/PLP-WebTechnologies/feb-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Mwaniqi26.

Challenges Faced
Responsive Design:

Ensuring the website was responsive on different screen sizes was challenging. I used CSS media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes for smaller screens.

JavaScript Form Validation:

Initially, I faced issues with handling empty fields and properly triggering the validation. Once resolved, the form now provides real-time feedback to users if any fields are left incomplete.

Conclusion
This project helped me reinforce my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. By designing a multipage website with basic interactivity and deploying it, I gained valuable experience in web development and deployment using GitHub Pages. The website is fully responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
